# NuvotonReactionGame
A multiplayer reaction game using Nuvoton microcontrollers, where players compete to match LED blink counts in real time. Fast reflexes win the game!

## Project Overview

In this reaction game, LEDs blink a specified number of times across each player's board. The objective is simple but challenging: the first player to correctly press the number of blinks on their keypad wins the round. 

This project also features:
- **Buzzer feedback**: A buzzer provides auditory feedback to enhance the game experience.
- **LCD display**: Visuals on an LCD to track game progress, rounds, and scores.
- **Inter-board communication**: Boards are interconnected to manage real-time competition and player interactions.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements
- Three Nuvoton microcontroller boards
- LEDs, Keypads, Buzzers, LCD displays
- Required wiring and resistors for each board

### Features
- **Reaction Test**: Fast-paced reflex game where timing and accuracy are key.
- **Multiplayer Interconnectivity**: Synchronizes multiple microcontroller boards for simultaneous play.
- **Auditory & Visual Feedback**: Real-time feedback via LED, buzzer, and LCD.
